## Application Documentation

Documenting your applications is important because you want those who'll use your applications, non-developers and developers to understand what your application does and how to go about getting it up and running.

## Application Usage For Consumers

+ Application Usage is important because here you'll list steps for consumers on how to use your application. Whether it be:

- Creating an account, Logging In and/or Signing Out.
- Navigating around your application.
- What information you need from the consumer.
- How to view information.
- What the purpose are of certain buttons, filters, links etc.
- What their limitations are in using your application as a certain account type.

+ All these steps must be listed so that they can understand the flow of data within your application and how to get the best out of it, in solving whatever problem they might have.

## Application Usage For Developers

+ Application Usage for developers is equally as important as the usage for Consumers because unlike Consumers they won't just use the final product/service, developers want to set up your application locally on their machine and understand how the code and data flow works. So it's important to list steps for Developers to go about setting up your application locally. Thinks to include are:

- Technology used.
- Languages used.
- Installation Steps for certain Technologies and Platforms.
- Database used and how to install it and set it up on their local machine.
