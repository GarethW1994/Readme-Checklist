## Application Documentation

Documenting your applications is important because you want those who'll use your applications, non-developers and developers to understand what your application does and how to go about getting it up and running.

## Application Usage For Consumers

+ Application Usage is important because here you'll list steps for consumers on how to use your application. Whether it be:

- Creating an account, Logging In and/or Signing Out.
- Navigating around your application.
- What information you need from the consumer.
- How to view information.
- What the purpose are of certain buttons, filters, links etc.
- What their limitations are in using your application as a certain account type.

+ All these steps must be listed so that they can understand the flow of data within your application and how to get the best out of it, in solving whatever problem they might have.

## Application Usage For Developers

+ Application Usage for developers is equally as important as the usage for Consumers because unlike Consumers they won't just use the final product/service, Developers want to set up your application locally on their machine and understand how the code and data flow works. So it's important to list steps for Developers to go about setting up your application locally. Thinks to include are:

### Getting Started
- Forking the repository to their Github account.
- Cloning the repository on their local machine.

### Installations
- Installation Steps for Technologies and Platforms.
- Installation Steps for Stack that were used.

### Stack Used
- Technologies used.
- Development Languages used.

### Terminal
- List terminal/command-line commands and environment variables to use.
- How to navigate into a repo of your machine on their local machine.
- How to open the code in their or preferred editor.

### Node Modules / Dependencies
- If a stack such as NodeJS were used you have to list steps on how to install Node Modules and Dependencies.


### Database Set-Up
- Database used and how to install it and set it up on their local machine.
- How to view the data in the database.
- What environment variables to use.
  - How to go about viewing, editing, delete, updating, search, for data in the database.

### Unit Testing
- List what Unit Testing Tools were used and how to set it up.
- If any third party testing tools / online testing tools were used, list them and guide Developers on how to set it up and run Unit Tests for your application.

### Server Set Up
- How to run your application on a local server.
- How to stop your application from running.

## Conclusion

- All these steps and documentation for your application are important to help people who want use your application, to better understand what it is your application does and how to use it. Developers can extend the functionality of your application and it's important for them to know how your application works behind the scene.
